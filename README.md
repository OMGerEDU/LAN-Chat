# LAN-Chat
Local network chat, contains both server to run on and a client with GUI to message between users.



First time launch:
- Create new RSA keys with the rsaa script.
- Put the keys.text file only in the client folder 
- Keep both on the server folder.

Afterwards: 

- Turn on and keep in the background the Server script.
- Create as many clients as you wish across the LAN. (as long as there are available ports)
